About
-----
Super Calculator is a plugin for Sublime Text 2 and Sublime Text 3 which lets you do inline calculations with a few keypresses. This is useful for example to subtract paddings from your widths in your CSS code.

Usage
-----
All you need to do is to press `Alt+C` and Super Calculator will select the mathematical expression closest to the cursor position so you can review what is going to be calculated. A second time `Alt+C` calculates the result and inserts it right away. Nice!

Keep Expressions Mode
---------------------
This mode allows to keep the expression after calculate the result.

| Behavior         	| Expression 	| result     	|
|------------------	|------------	|------------	|
| Default          	| 5 + 5      	| 10         	|
| Keep Expressions 	| 5 + 5      	| 5 + 5 = 10 	|
